#  Student Performance & Job Placement Prediction  

This project predicts **student performance (CGPA)** and whether a student will **get a job placement** based on multiple features such as study hours, attendance, internships, projects, technical skills, soft skills, and extracurricular activities.  

---

##  Features  
- **Regression Model** ‚Üí Predicts student **CGPA**.  
- **Classification Model** ‚Üí Predicts **Job Placement (Yes/No)**.  
- **Data Preprocessing** ‚Üí Label Encoding & One-Hot Encoding.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - For Job Placement ‚Üí Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix.  
  - For CGPA ‚Üí Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R¬≤ Score.  
- **Visualization** ‚Üí Shows relationships like Attendance vs. CGPA.

| StudyHoursPerWeek   | Average weekly study hours |
| AttendanceRate      | Attendance percentage |
| Internships         | Number of internships done |
| ProjectsDone        | Number of academic projects completed |
| TechnicalSkills     | Count of technical skills |
| SoftSkills          | Level (1 = Beginner, 2 = Intermediate, 3 = Advanced) |
| Extracurricular     | Type of extracurricular activity |
| CGPA                | Cumulative Grade Point Average |
| JobPlacement        | Placement status (Yes/No) |

##  Results  
- **Job Placement Model** ‚Üí Achieved **100% accuracy** on sample dataset (Decision Tree).  
- **CGPA Model** ‚Üí Random Forest gave an **R¬≤ Score of 0.73**, showing good performance.  

---

##  Future Improvements  
- Add **Flask API** for backend integration.  
- Build a **ReactJS UI** for interactive predictions.  
- Train with a **larger real-world dataset** for better generalization.
